<h1>ExerciseTracker</h1>

This application is a part of the www.thecsharpacademy.com roadmap.<br>
Goal of the website is to become a (better) C# and .Net developper.<br>
<br>
<h2>About the project:</h2>
In this project we learned about the Repository Pattern and how to apply it.<br>
We needed to create a simple application that keeps track of exercises.<br>
<br>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
-The model should exists out of the following fields: Id INT, DateStart DateTime, DateEnd DateTime, Duration TimeSpan, Comments string.<br>
-The project needs atleast the folliwing pages: UserInput, ExerciseController, ExerciseService (where business logic will be handled) and ExerciseRepository.<br>
-Use EF or raw SQL, I chose to use EF.<br>
-Use Sqlite or SqlServer, I chose to use SQLServer.<br>
-Extra challenges: create a new branch and use either Dapper or ADO instead of Entity Framework, I chose Dapper.
<br>
<h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
- First time using repositories<br>
- Learned to use Dapper for the extra challenge.<br>
- The extra challenged showed how easy it is to change your code when using the Repository Pattern.<br>
<br>
<h2>Resources used:</h2>
- The documentation at the assignment page and the discord channel of www.thecsharpacademy.com <br>
- Microsoft docs<br>
- Various google and youtube searches about Repository Patterns<br>
- Used ChatGPT to assist me with some things to get a better understanding.<br>
